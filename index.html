				<h2>What is <strong>Digital Divide?</strong>
				</h2>

				<p> The use of and, subsequently, dependence on modern technology in our everyday lives have changed not
					only how people interact with one another (e.g., digital technology), but also how cities operate.
					“Smart cities”, or urban areas that use information and communication technologies for operational
					efficiency, utilize cameras and sensors— among other tools— to collect data and use insights for
					urban planning and development. However, the systematic implementation of new and improved
					technologies as a result do not always meet and satisfy the various needs of city residents. In this
					project, we will reflect on how different “smart” technologies disproportionately impact smart city
					residents— particularly low-income residents— such that inequitable access to and utilization of
					technology have broader social implications and lead to other disparities; this is known as digital
					exclusion.

								<h3>Technology Advances</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Modern technology has become so ingrained in everyday life and normalized in society that
								it is difficult to imagine the existence of technological disparities. Digital
								exclusion, otherwise known as the digital divide, has far-reaching and long-lasting
								consequences for those that are impacted— especially for those from low-income
								backgrounds— such that the lack of access to and utilization of technology limits their
								life opportunities.</p>

								<h3>Seattle's growth as a tech hub </h3>
							</header>
							<p>Seattle is growing as one of the main tech hubs in the states. Seattle is the nation's
								fastest growing tech hub. According to GeekWire, “No city has added more tech jobs in
								the last two years than Seattle.” New reports show that companies in San Francisco and
								other hubs continue to flock to the pacific northwest to take advantage of its top-tier
								talent.</p>

								<h3>Smart City</h3>
							</header>
							<p>As Seattle transitions to a smart city, citizens of the Seattle metro area will
								experience technology designed to improve their quality of life, while having the
								opportunity to meet the growing demand for jobs in the tech industry. According to an
								analysis by CBRE real estate, “Seattle brought in more than 48,000 tech jobs from 2016
								to 2020, bringing the total number of tech employees in the Seattle metro area to
								184,662.”</p>

							<p>Seattle has grown by 70,000 people in the past five years and will grow by 120,000 more by 2035, 
							   a 31 percent population increase. Our city government staff will likely not increase at a similar 
							   rate, although the city needs will continue to grow. This includes everything from sustainability 
							   and energy use to safety and effective service delivery</p>

								<h3>Technological Progress</h3>

							<p>Technology have been growing significantly in the past years. A technological change involves the 
								invention of technologies and their release as open source via research and development, the 
								continual improvement of the technologies, and the diffusion of the technologies throughout the 
								industry or society.</p>

							<p>Seattle shows no signs of slowing its progress as it climbs to many of the top economic and quality

								other tourist and business ventures, it very well may become the new Silicon Valley. With all its

								<h3>The Internet</h3>

							<p>The internet has shows advancement throughout the years. Today living without the 
								internet is almost impossible. Once considered a luxury, high-speed internet is now found in roughly three-quarters of American 
								households. The web served a key role in making the internet popular among the general public and in 
								developing the boundless trove of information that most people can access on daily basis. No matter how far 
								away you are from your friends and family, you can easily stay connected with them and be a part of their
								lives.</p>
